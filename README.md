This project is to create a workday scheduler.

I used bootstrap to do a simple layout grid.
I used moments.js to have a time functionality. 
Used jQuery to write the functions to compare current time with schedule time for color blocking.
Used local storage to save the text for the enter items and allowed them to be change and reload when refreshed on page.
The local storage was linked to a save button for easy use.
